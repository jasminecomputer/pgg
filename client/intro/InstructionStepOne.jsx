            In this multi-player game, you will be in a group. Each person is
            given a set amount of money units at the start of each round. You
            will also be shown a money multiplier. There will be a public fund
            that you can choose to contribute toâ€”you will not be able to see
            others' contributions before making your own. After everyone has
            contributed, the amount in the public fund will be multiplied by the
            money multiplier.
          </p>

          ></img>
          <p>
            This amount is then evenly divided among the group as the "payoff".
            You get to keep the payoff and whatever you have left of your
            private funds.
          </p>
          <h1> Cumulative payoff: </h1>
          <p>
            You will have a cumulative payoff throughout the game, with each
            round's earnings being added to this amount. Try to maximize your
            cumulative payoff! When the game concludes, this will be converted
            to a cash bonus towards your final earnings.
